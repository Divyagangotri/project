# 🛡️ Preventing Keyloggers Using Kali Linux

This project addresses the growing threat of keyloggers—software or hardware tools used to covertly monitor and record keystrokes. It implements detection, prevention, and mitigation strategies using Kali Linux and Python-based techniques to enhance system security.



## 📌 Problem Statement

Keyloggers pose a serious threat to digital security, enabling cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as passwords, financial credentials, and personal data. This project aims to develop efficient tools to detect and prevent such threats in real time.



## 🧠 Solution Overview

The solution includes a multi-layered defense strategy:
- **Anti-keylogger modules**
- **Real-time monitoring and behavior analysis**
- **Preventive measures** like automatic form-fillers, OTPs, and voice-to-text systems
- **AI-powered detection models** based on user behavior and keystroke dynamics



## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 Real-time keylogger detection using Python and behavioral analysis
- 🛑 Preventive methods including OTPs, mouse gestures, and voice typing
- 🧠 AI-driven prediction and auto-remediation of threats
- 🧾 Packet monitoring and logging for audit and traceability
- 🔐 Ethical use in penetration testing and system diagnosis



## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Operating System**: Kali Linux
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Security Tools**: Wireshark, Nmap
- **Libraries**: `keyboard`, `logging`, `os`, `pynput` (optional)
- **Techniques**: Keystroke logging, network monitoring, anomaly detection



## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Import modules** and set up logging.
2. **Capture keystrokes** using Python’s `keyboard.on_press()` method.
3. **Log data** to a local file securely.
4. **Monitor user behavior** to detect potential intrusions.
5. **Simulate attacks** to evaluate effectiveness and resilience.


## 📊 Results

- Successful detection and mitigation of keylogging activity in real-time.
- Enhanced security posture through multi-layered prevention.
- Raised awareness about ethical implications and best practices in digital defense.


## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with cloud-based alerting systems.
- Deploy machine learning models for anomaly-based detection.
- Build browser extensions for added security in form submissions.
